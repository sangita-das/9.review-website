        <p className="text-light">
          The <span className="fw-bold text-primary  ">Learning Point</span> partners with schools and communities by providing evidence-based programs and instructional strategies to meet the needs of each individual learner. Our mission to close the gap between educational research and educational practice is carried out through our individualized programs for students, professional development for educators, and school-wide solutions for administrators.

          What's a learning point?  A student's learning point is a multi-faceted determination that captures his or her current academic standing. A learning point shows educators, parents, and advocates exactly where to meet each child and helps to determine the best instructional strategies and interventions to promote student growth.

          Over the past five years, The Learning Point has served hundreds of students in the Northeast by partnering with schools and community organizations. Learning Point scholars enroll in our programs several grade levels behind their national peers and typically advance one entire academic year within a few short weeks. Our programs are effective, individualized, fun, and game-changing for our scholars.
